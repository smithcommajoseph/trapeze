A less Cartoon-like theme for Open Atrium
=========================================

Trapeze currently does not modify any of the existing functionality of Open Atrium. It attempts to strip some of the loud colors and large icons and allow site creators to focus more on their content.

Installation:
-------------

- Place Trapeze in your /sites/all/themes directory
- Enable the Trapeze as your Default theme 


Note:
-----

Trapeze is a subtheme of Ginko (OA's default theme) and attempts to follow the patterns that Ginko (and Rubik... and Tao...) have set. This should make it easy for themers to extend and modify. If you know OA, then you know Trapeze.
